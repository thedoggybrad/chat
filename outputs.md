## Provide the lyrics of Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas<br>
Let's sing a happy song<br>
With joy and laughter all around us<br>
The season can't go wrong<br><br>

Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas<br>
May your heart be filled with cheer<br>
And may the love of family and friends<br>
Bring you happiness throughout the year<br><br>

Chorus:<br>
So let's raise our voices high<br>
And sing out loud for all to hear<br>
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas<br>
To everyone far and near<br><br>

Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas<br>
Let's decorate the tree<br>
With lights that twinkle bright like stars<br>  
For all the world to see<br><br>

Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas<br>
Let's share our gifts with care<br>
And spread kindness everywhere we go<br>
To show how much we truly care<br><br>

(Chorus)<br><br>

Bridge: <br>
As we gather 'round this time of year <br>
We remember those who are not here  <br>
But their memories will always stay  <br>
In our hearts each and every day  <br><br>

(Chorus x2)
