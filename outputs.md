## Provide the lyrics of Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas<br>
Let's sing a happy song<br>
With joy and laughter all around us<br>
The season can't go wrong<br><br>

Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas<br>
May your heart be filled with cheer<br>
And may the love of family and friends<br>
Bring you happiness throughout the year<br><br>

Chorus:<br>
So let's raise our voices high<br>
And sing out loud for all to hear<br>
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas<br>
To everyone far and near<br><br>

Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas<br>
Let's decorate the tree<br>
With lights that twinkle bright like stars<br>  
For all the world to see<br><br>

Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas<br>
Let's share our gifts with care<br>
And spread kindness everywhere we go<br>
To show how much we truly care<br><br>

(Chorus)<br><br>

Bridge: <br>
As we gather 'round this time of year <br>
We remember those who are not here  <br>
But their memories will always stay  <br>
In our hearts each and every day  <br><br>

(Chorus x2)

## Give me a code for a PHP Based Contact Form
Here is a basic PHP code for a contact form:<br><br><br>

```<br>
<?php<br>
if(isset($_POST['submit'])){<br>
    $name = $_POST['name'];<br>
    $email = $_POST['email'];<br>
    $message = $_POST['message'];<br><br>

    $to = "youremail@example.com";<br>
    $subject = "New Contact Form Submission";<br><br>
    
    // Email headers<br>
    $headers .= 'From: '.$name.' <'.$email.'>' . "\r\n" .<br>
        'Reply-To: '.$email.'' . "\r\n" .<br>
        'X-Mailer: PHP/' . phpversion();<br><br>

   // Email body<br>
   $body .= "Name: ".$name."\n";<br>
   $body .= "Email: ".$email."\n";<br>
   $body .= "Message:\n".$message;<br><br>

  // Send email using mail() function<br>
  if(mail($to, $subject, $body, $headers)){<br>
      echo "<p>Your message has been sent successfully!</p>";<br>
  } else {<br>
      echo "<p>There was an error sending your message. Please try again later.</p>";<br>
  }<br>
}<br>
?><br><br>

<form method="post"><br>
  <label>Name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" name="name"><br><br>

  <label>Email:</label><br>
  <input type="email" name="email"><br><br>

  <label>Message:</label><br>
  <textarea name="message"></textarea><br>

<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit"><br>
</form><br>
```<br><br><br>

Note that this is just a basic example and you may need to modify it to fit your specific needs (e.g. adding validation or additional fields). Also make sure to replace `youremail@example.com` with the actual email address where you want to receive the messages.
