## Introduction
TheDoggyBrad Chat can do anything, and much more—often with fewer instructions. It is able to solve logic problems, determine cause and effect, understand the intent of text, produce creative content, explain character motives, and handle complex summarization tasks. But..... wait this is optimized to avoid the chatbot to produce randomized results and repetitive results. This could be possibly better than ChatGPT (in some areas).

## Possible Problems
Q: What if I get "Oops! Something went wrong while retrieving the response. Refresh the page and please try again."?
<br>
A: Simple, just refresh the page and re-enter your input. The refresh will change the API key you are using via a randomizer. Just use the refresh button on after the delete button. This software uses multiple API keys (if you use my software hosted on Github, if not it will be singular).

Since this is an open-source project dedicated to the public domain, I want everyone to be fair to every users of this software. Here are my own set of conditions to use this software fairly:<br>
1.) Everyone must not abuse or misuse this software especially that this software uses the author's API keys (unless you forked the project and used your own API keys). <br>
That's all, I do not have anything special in my terms and conditions for using this software. I do not just wanted this software's API key to be abused.
