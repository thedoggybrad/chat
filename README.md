## Introduction
TheDoggyBrad Chat can do anything, and much more—often with fewer instructions. It is able to solve logic problems, determine cause and effect, understand the intent of text, produce creative content, explain character motives, and handle complex summarization tasks. But..... wait this is optimized to avoid the chatbot to produce randomized results and repetitive results. This could be possibly better than ChatGPT (in some areas).

## Terms for "Fair" Usage
Since this is an open-source project dedicated to the public domain, I want everyone to be fair to every users of this software. Here are my own set of conditions to use this software fairly:<br>
1.) Everyone must not abuse my API access key. It is limited to 2500 maximum tokens. Abuse may cause the software to not produce any results in a minute or more (potentially the API key may be blocked).<br>
2.) Do not use my own "API Key", to not cause any problems to the users of this software. It is a free API Key, not paid so it has some limits. Yes, it is in public but it is hidden and not hosted here in Github. Use your own instead if you already forked this software and not using the original one I host in my repository (thedoggybrad/chat).<br>
That's all, I do not have anything special in my terms and conditions for using this software. I do not just wanted this software's API key to be abused.
